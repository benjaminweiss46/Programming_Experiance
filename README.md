For this class we had to create a website that gives all data about the application we are developing that aims to improve online communication in an age of Coronavirus. In the files you will see usibility testing, prototyping (hi-fi and lo-fi), and as the project goes on more steps we went through in developement. Our team is a group of 3 but I am specifically in charge of managing the website and creating the application. Though I can answer questions regarding any aspect of this project.
