For this class we had to create a website that gives all data about the application we are developing that aims to improve online communication in an age of Coronavirus. In the files you will see usibility testing, prototyping (hi-fi and lo-fi), and as the project goes on more steps we went through in developement. Our team is a group of 3 but I am specifically in charge of managing the website and creating the application. Though I can answer questions regarding any aspect of this project.

<b>My First Website</b>
<br>
Repository: https://github.com/benjaminweiss46/allergypedia
<br>
This was the first website I ever designed and made. Just for fun! I made this website since I thought there was a lack of knowledge available at the time for parents of children with allergies. Restaurants rarely posted allergy information at the time and if they did it was hard to find. So I designed this website to make it easier to get to that data. It was also my first time practicing and teaching myself HTML and CSS.
